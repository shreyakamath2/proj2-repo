## Project 2 - Web Scraping Data Analysis and Visualization:
An exploratory data analysis using Wikipedia and Wikitables to analyze various components of the film industry, including movie cost, earnings, actors/actresses, and award nominations. 
## Webpages Used in this Project:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_films# 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films_in_the_United_States_and_Canada# 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture#
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress# 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor# 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-paid_film_actors# 
## Data Science Questions:
The four questions I was trying to answer with this project are:
1) Which decade had the most top-earning movies?
2) Do the highest-grossing movies have a better likelihood of being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture?
3) Do the highest-paid actors and actresses get nominated for more Academy Awards for Best Actor/Actress?
4) Do more expensive films make more money at the box office?

1. WebScrapingProject2.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook containing code for setting up a web scraping pipeline from each of the webpages, placing the scraped data into a Pandas dataframe, performing data cleaning operations on the dataframes, performing calculations with the dataframes, and creating data visualizations in Matplotlib/Seaborn.
